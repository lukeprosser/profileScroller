# Profile Scroller
A simple 'dating-style' app built as part of 'Modern JavaScript' with Brad Traversy. Allows the user to view multiple profiles.

Data set is hard coded for demonstration purposes. Users are sourced from https://randomuser.me/ API.

## Key Features
<ul>
  <li>Default profile displayed on initial page load.</li>
  <li>User can skip through profiles by clicking the 'Next' button (via an event listener).</li>
  <li>An iterator function continues to iterate through profiles while the current iteration is less than the total number of profiles.</li>
  <li>Profiles are updated dynamically by amending HTML and CSS, and pulling in data via template literals</li>
  <li>Once all profiles have been shown, the window will reload automatically.</li>
</ul>
